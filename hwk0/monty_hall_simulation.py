Function
--------
goat_door

Simulate the opening of a "goat door" that doesn't contain the prize,
and is different from the contestants guess

Parameters
----------
prizedoors : array
    The door that the prize is behind in each simulation
guesses : array
    THe door that the contestant guessed in each simulation

Returns
-------
goats : array
    The goat door that is opened for each simulation. Each item is 0, 1, or 2, and is different
    from both prizedoors and guesses

Examples
--------
>>> print goat_door(np.array([0, 1, 2]), np.array([1, 1, 1]))

Parameters
----------
guesses : array
     Array of original guesses, for each simulation
goatdoors : array
     Array of revealed goat doors for each simulation

Returns
-------
The new door after switching. Should be different from both guesses and goatdoors

Examples
--------
>>> print switch_guess(np.array([0, 1, 2]), np.array([1, 2, 1]))

Now, put it together. Simulate 10000 games where contestant keeps his original guess, and 10000 games where the contestant switches his door after a goat door is revealed. Compute the percentage of time the contestant wins under either strategy. Is one strategy better than the other?
